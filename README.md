## How to use
1. Open a terminal and clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/meijer-jeroen/contingent-evolution-2020`
2. Download the raw data from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3840463
3. Extract the data and place it in the folder 'contingent-evolution-2020/data/raw'
4. make subdirectories 'contingent-evolution-2020/figures' and 'contingent-evolution-2020/data/temp' 
5. Use Rstudio to open the contingent-evolution-2020.Rproj file found in main folder, and run individual scripts in the 'src' folder to generate the figures. Some figures might require pre-processing of data with supplied scripts.
